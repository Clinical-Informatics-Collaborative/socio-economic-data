### The Aim
The topic of Eco-system links Australian clinic data to social economic data targeting the underneath mental health issue. The choropleth map aims to show the regional factors that affect the mental heath clinical behaviours. 


### Prepare the environment
The author use Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries are listed below.
``` python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
``` 
Also, make sure all packages are update to the latest version, especially 
```
pip install --upgrade pillow
pip install --upgrade matplotlib

```

### Prepare the data

The geographic data is collect from [https://data.gov.au/geoserver/vic-suburb-locality-boundaries-psma-administrative-boundaries/wfs?request=GetFeature&typeName=ckan_af33dd8c_0534_4e18_9245_fc64440f742e&outputFormat=json]

The clinical data is synthetic data generating on Synthea. 

The  `synthetic.csv` in data folder is a fake generated data for drafting the map. The topic of this dataset mainly focus on the ratio of low income range by gender and suburb in Australia. 
The `social-eco.csv` data is social-economic data that we use to link to the clinic synthetic data.

### Data Wrangling
Check missing values, fill/drop null values, geometry column in GeoData dataframe, datatypes.

### Modify the map

The choropleth map is generated by Geopandas and pyplot library.
