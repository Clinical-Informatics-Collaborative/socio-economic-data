### The Aim
The topic of Eco-system links Australian mental illness data to social economic data targeting the underneath mental health issue. The choropleth map aims to show the social-economic factors and regional factors in Victoria that affect the mental heath clinical behaviors. 

You can read through our project's technical notes, including the choropleth map that implementing by r and Python bugs we fixed, the detailed Synthea data generating notes and code, the matlab analysis on raw data and data-related documents [here](https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/StudentInternGroupatWEHI/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=nuYayz&cid=19b1b5ac%2D0223%2D4203%2Da521%2D4f50200c0188&FolderCTID=0x0120008FF8F20683AC284798EA496C639CC069&id=%2Fsites%2FStudentInternGroupatWEHI%2FShared%20Documents%2FClinical%20Dashboards%2F2023%20Semester%202%20Technical%20notes&viewid=afd55542%2D8e3a%2D4327%2D95f9%2D63450ae10d2a). 

### Prepare the environment
The author use Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries are listed below.

``` python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd 
import geoplot as gplt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import mapclassify as mc
import contextily as ctx
``` 
Also, make sure all packages are update to the latest version, especially 
```
pip install --upgrade pillow
pip install --upgrade matplotlib
```

### Prepare the data

The geographic data is collect from [Australian government website](https://data.gov.au/geoserver/vic-suburb-locality-boundaries-psma-administrative-boundaries/wfs?request=GetFeature&typeName=ckan_af33dd8c_0534_4e18_9245_fc64440f742e&outputFormat=json). The VIC .shp data can be downloaded [here](https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/StudentInternGroupatWEHI/Shared%20Documents/Clinical%20Dashboards/2023%20Semester%202%20Technical%20notes/Python%20Dashboard%20-%20draft%20data%20used/data/GDA2020?csf=1&web=1&e=FdzQNm).
The [clinical data and Australian demographic data](https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/StudentInternGroupatWEHI/Shared%20Documents/Clinical%20Dashboards/synthea%202023?csf=1&web=1&e=O3qgY9) are synthetic data generating on Synthea. We also choose actual social-eco data from ABS, [Socioeco_data_poa_modified.csv](https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/StudentInternGroupatWEHI/Shared%20Documents/Clinical%20Dashboards/2023%20Semester%202%20Technical%20notes/SEIFA%20dataset/Socioeco_data_poa_modified%20.csv?d=w9837d55a5cd143569f557f86b3adfeca&csf=1&web=1&e=16LCbH).

**A reminder**

If your team stuck at handling Synthea platform, try this data to not stop/waste time.
The [synthetic_data_Python_generated.csv](https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/StudentInternGroupatWEHI/Shared%20Documents/Clinical%20Dashboards/2023%20Semester%202%20Technical%20notes/synthetic_data_Python_generated.csv?d=w462c8ef8e3ba4b978616e4d4bf27f2f1&csf=1&web=1&e=lwyp5I) is a dummy data generating using Python for drafting the map. The topic of this dataset mainly focus on the ratio of low income range by gender and suburb in Australia. 


### Data Wrangling
Glance all data, Check missing values, fill/drop null values, filter useful columns (some preprocessing is done [here](https://github.com/Clinical-Informatics-Collaborative/socio-economic-data/blob/main/Synthea%20data/preprocess.ipynb)), combine data, geometry column in GeoData dataframe, datatypes.


### Construct the map
The choropleth map is generated by Geopandas and pyplot library. There are more combinations of creating an interactive map in python, there are a few articles I researched:
